Just a random name, we can change it if we get better ideas.

http://couchapp.org/page/index has lots of information.

https://github.com/benoitc/erica looks like the way to deploy.  I'll experiment
with this.  This does require erlang and gcc to compile; I don't know how easy
it is on Windows.

If you have trouble with it, there's a Python version (couchapp), which is
deprecated in favor of Erica but probably still works.

jQuery interface for CouchDB:
http://daleharvey.github.io/jquery.couch.js-docs/symbols/index.html
(note the $.couch.db in sidebar with more methods)
This comes with your CouchDB install.

I'll see if I can get erica talking to an IrisCouch instance.
