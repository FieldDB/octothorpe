TODO / IDEAS

include document in changes poll, to save a request?

investigate other events than keydown. These two look interesting:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver

if save fails, should we pull&transform and try again, or trust that a change request is coming our way?
no harm in an extra pull

rich text?

tabs in text?

do we want to refresh home when page titles change?
We're currently filtering changes to only refresh the homepage when a new
document is created.  In order to filter on name changes, we'd need to to add
a flag to the document "nameChanged", which is only true if the last update
changed the name.

rework profile & document creation stuff

Allow sending request for write access, if denied.

URL rewriting
