TODO / IDEAS

include document in changes poll, to save a request?

investigate other events than keydown. These two look interesting:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver

if save fails, should we pull&transform and try again, or trust that a change request is coming our way?
no harm in an extra pull

rich text?

save indicator

tabs in text?

changeable titles
note: do we want to refresh home when this happens?
We're currently filtering changes to only refresh the homepage when a new
document is created.  In order to filter on name changes, we'd need to to add
a flag to the document "nameChanged", which is only true if the last update
changed the name.

rework profile & document creation stuff

Major: implement ownership and access control
Some sensitive parts need to happen on the server, in validate_doc_update

Per-document read control is a problem.
The solution people seem to have for read control is a separate DB for each
access group (or even each user), with filtered replication so it only
contains the data they can read.  If we get bored we can work on this, but it
seems like it's too complicated for now.

Write control is easy enough, though.

URL rewriting
turn "/octothorpe/_design/octothorpe/index.html" into just "/index.html"

Styling. Make it pretty.
