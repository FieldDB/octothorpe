document sharing

granular access - owner of document can restrict writing
-- even visibility & reading

users & auth*
probably do this in couch itself
step 2; first do global r/w

list of all docs
edit documents
create documents

stretch stuff: operational transform
fork documents
old versions
anycasted global multi-master network for latency (not going to happen)
hot spare

home: list documents, link to create document

create document: title, content

view document: link to edit
live update checkbox

edit document: title, content, delete
can you edit title? sure, why not
note: title doesn't uniquely identify
have some (hidden-ish) id field

what do we do on new version?

while editing: poll for changes and commit mine, every n seconds
if ours was out of date, discard and refresh
(future: use OT)

updates: polling, long polling, websockets

show editors/viewers

lock per-line, merge with basic diff algorithm?
exclusive lock?

what sort of server stack?
client-side js?
php?
node?
ruby/python?


architecture:
linux server
couchdb
apache/nginx
html, js
maybe something server-side
clients access with browser
